        <h1>Practicing my code...  <em>alone</em>  </h1>
        <p>I have used the keyboard shortcut (!) to start my page today.</p>
        <p>I used it to copy the boilerplate until it's muscle memory.</p>
        <p>Also I decided to create a new git repo on my desktop that I'll be using to keep track of my blog</p>
        <p>I'm very excited about using git from the command line,  <em>and</em>  being able to practice using git</p>
        <p>I'll be using this file along with others to engage with any of my  <strong>future selves</strong></p>
